<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    French toast is a dish made of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and typically milk, 
    then pan fried. Alternative names and variants include "eggy bread", "Bombay toast", 
    "gypsy toast", and "poor knights" (of Windsor).
</p>
<p>
    When French toast is served as a sweet dish, milk, sugar, vanilla or cinnamon are also 
    commonly added before pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), 
    butter, fruit, or syrup.
