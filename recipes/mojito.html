<h1>The Real Mojito</h1>

<p>
    A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, this cocktail uses 
    ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and sugar. 
</p>
<p>
    The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching libation. 
    It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first muddling fresh mint, 
    lime, and sugar together to release the flavors.

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>10 fresh mint leaves.</li>
    <li>½ medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided.</li>

    <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed.</li>
    <li>1 ½ fluid ounces white rum.</li>
    <li>½ cup club soda, or as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>

    </li>
    <li>
        Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.
    </li>
